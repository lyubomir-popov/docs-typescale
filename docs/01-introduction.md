# Introduction

### Precision as a Design Philosophy

At Canonical, precision isn't just a brand value—it's the foundation of how we approach every design decision. This commitment to precision led us to Spencer Mortensen's groundbreaking work on modernizing classical typographic scales, which transforms centuries-old typographic principles into mathematically rigorous, infinite harmonic sequences.

Where traditional type scales relied on approximation and visual judgment, Mortensen's approach provides exact mathematical relationships that ensure perfect harmonic progression across any number of sizes. This mathematical precision resonates deeply with Canonical's engineering culture and our commitment to systematic, repeatable design decisions.

### Purpose and Scope

This documentation presents Canonical's Type Scale system—a comprehensive typographic framework that delivers consistency across three distinct domains:

- **Documentation**: Technical content requiring information density with semantic emphasis
- **Applications**: Interactive interfaces demanding sustained user focus and optimal readability
- **Editorial**: Marketing and content experiences prioritizing accessibility and scanability

Rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach, our system recognizes that different contexts demand different typographic strategies. Each domain is carefully optimized for its specific use case while maintaining mathematical harmony through our shared foundational principles.

### Our Contribution to the Design Community

This project extends beyond Canonical's internal needs. We've developed and open-sourced sophisticated font metrics extraction tools that automate the traditionally tedious manual process of baseline alignment calculations. These tools enable other organizations to implement similarly rigorous typographic systems with their own font choices, contributing to higher standards across the broader design community.

By sharing both our methodology and our tools, we aim to elevate the level of typographic sophistication available to design teams everywhere, particularly in enterprise contexts where precision and consistency are paramount.

### What Makes This System Different

Our Type Scale system distinguishes itself through:

**Mathematical Rigor**: Built on Spencer Mortensen's infinite harmonic sequences rather than simple ratio-based approximations

**Domain Specialization**: Purpose-built typographic strategies for documentation, applications, and editorial content

**Baseline Grid Integration**: Enterprise-level precision with every typographic element aligned to a consistent baseline grid

**Brand Alignment**: Direct connection between typographic decisions and Canonical's core value of precision

**Community Impact**: Open-source tooling that enables other organizations to implement similar levels of typographic sophistication

### How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is designed for design leaders, UX professionals, developers, and anyone seeking to understand enterprise-level typographic decision-making. Each section builds upon the previous, moving from theoretical foundation through practical implementation.

We focus on design strategy and rationale rather than implementation details—our goal is to build trust in our design process and help you understand the thinking behind each decision. For technical implementation details, we provide links to our open-source repositories and tools.
